### Short Description

One-tap launcher for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI apps.

### Full Description

AI Launcher gives you a single screen to open your favourite AI apps.

Supported apps:
• ChatGPT
• Claude
• Gemini
• Microsoft Copilot
• Grok
• Perplexity
• DeepSeek
• Poe

Just tap an icon to open the app. If it's not installed, you'll be taken to the Play Store to download it.

You can reorder the grid by long-pressing and dragging, and hide apps you don't use from the edit screen.

AI Launcher doesn't collect any data, doesn't require an account, and doesn't connect to the internet. Your preferences (app order and visibility) are stored locally on your device and nowhere else.

It's a simple utility — nothing more, nothing less.
