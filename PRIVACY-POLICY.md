# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 2026

**AI Launcher** ("the App") is a free utility app developed by Tom Murton.

## Data Collection

The App does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Specifically:

- **No analytics** — the App contains no analytics or tracking SDKs.
- **No network requests** — the App does not connect to the internet. It only launches other apps via URL schemes and app store links.
- **No accounts** — the App does not require or support user accounts or sign-in.
- **No advertising** — the App contains no ads or ad-tracking.

## Local Storage

The App stores your preferences (which AI apps you have selected and their display order) locally on your device using AsyncStorage. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to anyone other than you
- Is deleted when you uninstall the App

## Third-Party Services

When you tap an AI app in the launcher, the App opens that app (or its app store page) using your device's standard URL scheme handling. The App has no control over the privacy practices of those third-party apps.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, the revised version will be posted here with an updated effective date.
